  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine, I'll message on the chat when the meditation is over.</div>
  <div>Today the aim is to complete as much of Unit 4 as possible - with the rest set as homework. This is so we can complete a mock Practical Exam together in the final lecture next week!</div>
