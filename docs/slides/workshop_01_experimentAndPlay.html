    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our second workshop and our first experiment/play session!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, you'll have done the following things:
    <ul>
      <li>Experimented with the p5.js forum</li>
      <li>Played with the p5.js website reference</li>
      <li>Experimented with the p5.js website examples</li>
      <li>Played with the p5.js showcase</li>
      <li>Downloaded VSCode</li>
      <li>Tried making a local p5.js sketch</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Don't worry about understanding all the code you'll see today - just get used to picking things you like and copying the code onto the p5.js editor or your own code editor - more about that later.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">Experiment with the p5.js forum for 5 minutes in groups</a>. What can you find? Try searching for things you are interested in.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">Play with the p5.js website reference for 5 minutes</a> - I always have this open when I'm writing code. Don't forget that all the code examples are editable right in your browser! Even on mobile!
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">Experiment with the p5.js website examples for 10 minutes</a> - try cut and pasting them into new sketches using your new p5.js editor login. Do they work? Why did you pick the ones that you did?
  </div>
  <div>
    Play with the <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/2020-All">2020 p5.js showcase</a> for 15 minutes. Can you find other years? Which are your favourites? Can you get them running on the p5.js editor?
  </div>
  <div>
    I'd like you take 5 minutes to download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft VSCode</a>. It's free text editor that allows you to write code on your own computer. The brilliant Daniel Shiffman has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJw0SyKO9IU">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec">different</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCHzlUiDD10">videos</a> on how he codes locally (not using the p5.js online editor, only working on his own computer). Why might it be better or easier to develop on your own computer?
  </div>
  <div>
    For the last 20 minutes of the workshop, I'd like you to pick a p5.js sketch you've liked today and get it running on your own computer. See the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">Get Started tutorial on the p5.js website for help</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server">Local Server tutorial on the p5.js GitHub wiki for even more help</a>. Both were written before VSCode came out, but the instructions should work for VSCode too. Shout me on the CCI Slack if you are stuck.
