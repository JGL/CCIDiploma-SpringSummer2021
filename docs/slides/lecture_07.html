  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine, I'll message on the chat when the meditation is over.</div>
  <div>Before we review the Making Decisions Playground, I want to go through <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/1089113/mod_resource/content/2/Assessment%20Brief%20IU000053%20Coding%20for%20Collaborative%20App%20Development.pdf">The Unit 4 Assignment Brief</a> - in other words, the two tests you'll be having at the end of term. They'll be similar to the ones you did for Unit 1 - a multiple choice test on your knowledge of Swift and a programming exam where you'll make an iOS application. Last year's Swift programming exam was cancelled because of Covid, but here are last years Swift multiple choice <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2021/blob/main/docs/pdf/2020_06_01_Unit4MultipleChoiceExamMOCKWithAnswers.pdf">mock test</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2021/blob/main/docs/pdf/2020_05_25_Unit4MultipleChoiceExamREAL.pdf">real test</a>. Would Mock versions be useful?</div>
  <div>Now did the Making Decisions Playground go? (Page 131 of the Student Guide and the Making Decisions Playground on page 132 of the Student Guide).</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look the Apply and Extend section on page 212 of the Teacher Guide.</div>
  <div>Next, let's go over the Reflection Questions on page 129 of your Student Guide (see page 218 of your Teacher Guide, Joel).</div>
  <div>Let's go over the Summary on page 134 of the Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 135 of the Student Guide and complete the Boogie Bot Playground together.</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 136 of the Student Guide and complete the Data Visualisation Playground together.</div>
  <div>Now let's turn to page 139 of the Student Guide and complete the "Build a QuestionBot App" together.</div>
  <div>Now let's go through the Apple and Extend section of the Teacher Guide on page 236 of the Teacher Guide.</div>
  <div>For homework, I'd like you to complete "Episode 2 - The Viewing Party" on page 164 of your Student Guide.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
