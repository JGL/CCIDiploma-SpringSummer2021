## Code of Conduct

You can find the UAL Disciplinary Code For Students here: [Disciplinary Code For Students](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/student-regulations/disciplinary-code-for-students).

You can find our code of conduct here: [code_of_conduct.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), it was cloned from [https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](the p5.js code of conduct).

[Golan Levin](https://www.flong.com/) also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T – is it True?
> - H – is it Helpful?
> - I – is it Inspiring?
> - N – is it Necessary?
> - K – is it Kind?

## Block/Term Structure

The [Diploma in Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma) is split into two blocks of teaching. **Block 1** takes up the entire Autumn term and half of the Spring term. **Block 2** follows on, taking the second half of Spring term and the entire Summer term.

**Block 1** consists of three units:

- Unit 1: Creative Coding and Creative Computing Frameworks - taught by me and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).
- Unit 2: Introducing Computational Futures and Artificial Intelligence - taught by [Alex Fefegha](https://designcode.art/) and [Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute/people/rebecca-fiebrink).
- [Unit 3: Creative Practice: Visual Coding and Physical Computing](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit3) - taught by [Indira Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indira-k-bb857515b/) and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).

In addition, [Vali Lalioti](https://www.theinnovationconsultancy.com/about/) will be supporting the online Diploma cohort for all units.

**Block 2** consists of three units:

- Unit 4: Coding for Collaborative App Development - taught by me.
- Unit 5: Working and the Digital Creative Industries - taught by [Alex Fefegha](https://designcode.art/).
- Unit 6: Creative Practice: Computational Environments - taught by [Indira Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indira-k-bb857515b/) and [Emile Giles](http://emiliegiles.co.uk/).

In addition [Dr. Vali Lalioti](https://www.theinnovationconsultancy.com/about/) will be supporting the online Diploma cohort for all units.

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment)):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It’s how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It’s how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It’s how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going — developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It’s how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you’ve learned. It’s taking a look back and evaluating the work you’ve produced.

At the end of this block (midway through the 2021 Spring term) you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear, I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with new creative computing core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new creative computing knowledge to their chosen BA subject elsewhere at University of the Arts London (UAL).

### Unit 4 / Block 2: "Coding for Collaborative App Development"

1. Design and prototype a mobile application (_Knowledge_, _Process_)
   - [Swift](https://swift.org/)
   - [Apple Developer Higher Education Swift site](https://www.apple.com/education/higher-education/app-development/)
2. Use collaborative software tools (_Communication_, _Realisation_)
   - [Slack](https://slack.com/)
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
3. Understand and code for a popular mobile development stack (_Enquiry_, _Knowledge_)
   - [Apple Developer Higher Education Swift site](https://www.apple.com/education/higher-education/app-development/)
   - [Apple Developer Swift site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
   - [Apple Developer iOS site](https://developer.apple.com/ios/)

### Teaching Style

I'll be teaching using Apple's [Develop In Swift Explorations](https://books.apple.com/us/book/develop-in-swift-explorations/id1511184149) course. The course is made of four units, with an episode section between each unit. Each unit is split into four sections:

1. **_Get Started_**
   - You’ll begin by learning the key concepts covered in the unit, exploring how they relate to your everyday experiences, and completing activities that deepen your understanding. By using coding concepts to think about everyday problems, you’ll also be learning to think critically, to see the world as a programmer, and to apply computational reasoning.
2. **_Play_**
   - In this section, you’ll apply the key concepts in Xcode playgrounds, where you can experiment with code and see the results immediately. As you complete each activity, you can check your understanding by answering review questions in the book. You’ll also apply your understanding of the unit concepts through fun, creative playground challenges that will help you start thinking about your own app projects. Later in the book, you’ll build simple apps to explore development topics.
3. **_Build_**
   - You’ll be guided through the steps of building an app in Xcode. For this section, you’ll want to keep this book open while you’re working in Xcode.
4. **_Design_**
   - You’ll explore the impact of computing innovations and experience the app design process. You’ll also consider the choices that app designers and developers make, knowing that their app could impact thousands—even millions—of people.

Between the units, the episodes tell the story of a group of TV club students as they use technology in their daily lives. Each episode introduces key concepts about technology—and challenges you to analyse the students’ choices and to reflect on your own practices.

This will be the first time that I've taught using this material, so I'd love to hear all feedback - good and bad!

_**You are expected to undertake independent study of 25 hours per week over the three units that you will be taught every block.**_

## Working in groups of three

~~Throughout the term, you will be working in pairs. This is a technique known as [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). You may change pair partner as often or sparingly as you like.~~

Following the [latest research](https://twitter.com/helenbevan/status/1175650749797167104?s=11), I've decided to shift us from pairs to threes. After all, [three is a magic number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np0YIaHv6LQ)</a>.

## Assessment

At the end of Block 1 (halfway through the Spring Term) and at the end of Block 2 (at the end of the Summer Term), you will be assessed individually. The two units I teach (Unit 1 and Unit 4) are assessed in the same way:

Both units will be assessed in the same two ways - via multiple choice test and practical exam. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a 20 questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. You will be given 1 hour to complete the 20 multiple choice questions. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. You will be given 2 hours to complete the Practical Exam.

Because of Covid, last year only the Multiple Choice Swift Test was issued. Please find [last year's mock Multiple Choice Swift Test here](https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2021/blob/main/docs/pdf/2020_06_01_Unit4MultipleChoiceExamMOCKWithAnswers.pdf) and last year's [real Multiple Choice Swift Test here](https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-SpringSummer2021/blob/main/docs/pdf/2020_05_25_Unit4MultipleChoiceExamREAL.pdf).

Units 2 and 5 are assessed via an essay.

Units 3 and 6 are assessed via the submission of a 5 minute video and accompanying PDF document.
